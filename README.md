## The formula for the divergent series '1+2+3+4+5+..n' is n(n+1)/2 . 
## When n=5, the partial sum will be 15. For the given partial sum of 15, I want to find the n whose value will be 5.
## I have two python program, one using simple formula and other using TensorFlow.
## See how tensorflow fails for numbers like 55 and above. Also it is very slow.
